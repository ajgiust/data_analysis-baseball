# data_analysis-baseball

In this project, I gathered, assessed and cleaned baseball data from several sources then performed exploratory data analysis to draw 
inferences as to which batting and pitching metrics are most correlated with salary. 

## Getting Started

This project is informational and does not require you to run any code. This project is meant to display the analysis I conducted on 
the data I gathered.
